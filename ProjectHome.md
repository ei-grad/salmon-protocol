We want to stop fragmenting conversations on the Internet.  The Salmon protocol defines how comments can swim upstream to the resource being discussed.  It's open, standards based, decentralized, abuse resistant, and user centric.  Interested?  See http://salmon-protocol.org/ for more details, and [join the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/salmon-protocol/subscribe) to start participating.

The goals of this code project are:
  * A reference implementation and library developed in conjunction with, and proving out, the protocol specification.
  * A demonstration / playground application to show how Salmon works.
  * Tools and validators needed to help implementors interoperate.

The Magic Signatures and Salmon specifications are offered under the  [Open Web Foundation](http://openwebfoundation.org/)'s IPR agreement.

Libraries for Salmon can be found at SalmonLibraries.
